# Fresh-Food-App

<b>Overview</b><br>
Fresh Food App is a <ins>developmental</ins> project worked on by Wasay Ahmed, Christian Gutierrez, Jordan Nguyen, and Natalie Reyes during Spring 2022 at University of Illinois at Chicago for the course CS 440 Software Engineering 1 taught by Professor John Bell. 


File "Develop" contains project slides, app summaries, and app development report with extensive information including various diagrams, designs, and requirements.


The idea behind the Fresh Food App is that it will provide the user with information regarding food edibility by using a seperate hardware with sensors to test the food item. The sensors would collect data on chemical odors that are detected. The app will then calculate the edibility and estimate expiration from the real time data sent by the sensors. Additionally, the user would be able to review food safety information and facts regarding that food item.
